                                I was born at Madidi then my family relocated to Klipgat and attended my primary education there.
                                Tlapa la Thuto Primary School until grade 5,that was when I lost my father(may his soul rest in peace)
                                After the burial of my father we relocated to Letlhabile as a reason of family disputes.I feel in
                                love with a technicon called Hebron Tech and that is when I wanted to study computer science and
                                their uniform was the same as uniform I used to wear at Tlapa la Thuto but unlucky for me,my
                                mother was unemployed so I had to put my dream on a hold.

                                After working for years as a field marketer, I had a strong working relationship with my field manager and
                                perishable manager of the shop I working at.My little brother had finished matric and started working
                                so he can assist us with daily bread,I sat my family down and explained how unhappy I was at work so we
                                agreed that it's time I follow my passion,the passion i had since grade 5 which was being a computer
                                doctor and they were really supportive and help me along the way.Working under retail is no much fun and you don't
                                get a chance to study so I had to correspond so that I can pay for my studies.I registered for Information
                                System Manager but that wasn't really what I wanted so I went to attend at Avuxheni Computer Academy
                                of which I realised after graduating that the short course didn't cover what I wanted.Institutions that
                                provide computer science are expensive and I couldn't enroll in one of them so I settled for the first chance
                                I discovered that I can afford and that was IT Academy, I did the course online and I finally graduated

                                I started applying and received negetive response from all companies I applied to,as a reason of work
                                experience then I got inspired to start my own company and NPO which will focus mainly on delivering
                                community work and help the upcoming IT Technicians so that they won't wait until they work to start
                                studying how computer operate. <b>MW Services</b> is the company that will invest it's time in teaching other
                                young stars like me who can't afford to study in the high institutions,make difference in our community
                                and change the world.I grew up under the influence of Rastafari and that also encouraged me to stop
                                working for others and start my own company from the ground so that the rising youths can learn and earn
                                within the company of <b>MW Services</b>
